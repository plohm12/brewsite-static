description: >-
  A bit more dank than I usually prefer my IPAs, this batch is an experiment in
  THC infusion. Low in potency all around, expect a mood boost more than
  anything else - you can probably have two bottles and stay grounded in
  reality. Made with Bergamot hops and OG Lime Killer hash.
